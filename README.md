## Tracking
Some of your info is collected by default by <b>google-analytics</b> so that I can can aggregate data such as browser type, device type, etc. and use it to provide a better site experience. I, however, respect your privacy so if your browser sends a <b> do not track </b> request the google-analytics script will not be executed and you will not be tracked (unless my code
is incorrect/buggy in which case contact me and i'll fix it ASAP).
<b>Cloudflare</b> may also aggregate some of your data in order to help me
mitigate threats (suchs as ddos attacks) and spot suspicious activity on my site.
